Hi, friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm glad you found me. My name is Ksenia Anske and I like to write.

On this site you can read my latest [blog posts](https://kseniaanske.github.io/archive.html), check out [my books](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ksenia-Anske/author/B00D3CSVTO), and [share](mailto:kseniaanske@gmail.com) your thoughts and ideas with me. I believe writing is a way to process life and to reflect on our learnings. To talk about our dreams and hopes and aspirations. And to explore our humanity. Who are we, where we come from, where we're going... I'd love to hear how my explorations may have inspired you to make explorations of your own, be it a story, a painting, a song. Or even a dance.

What do you say? What has inspired you lately?
